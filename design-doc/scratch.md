# Scratch Ideas

## Motor

38mm motor is the final choice. It is easier to obtain in Canada and will also
be cheaper.

The motor needs a retention method. Based on what I've heard from others who
have done an L2, a retention method similar to an Aeropack retainer (like my L1)
is suitable.

## Recovery

Dual deploy, dual break. Drogue at apogee, main halfway down. Switchband coupler
to house deployment avionics, which will consist of between \[1, 2\] barometric
altimeters capable of deploying 2 deployment charges each (main and drogue) at
different altitudes. Altimeters will also need to be capable of deploying after
a set time-limit as an extra precaution.

Deployment will use black-powder charges detonated by e-matches.

## Airframe

The airframe will be made of composites. All of the body tubes will be either
fiberglass or carbon fiber, but it is required that the avionics bay be
fiberglass for radio transparency.

The nosecone can be PETG 3D printed or a fiberglass layup on a 3D printed mold
(radio transparent).

## Avionics

\[1,2\] barometric altimeters for recovery deployment. Must perform on-board
altitude/charge detonation logging, be capable of firing two deployment charges
each and have some kind of audio indicator of arming and continuity check.

The avionics bay must be capable of supporting a redundant deployment
configuration.

The GPS tracker will go in the nosecone and at minimum must be capable of
providing coordinates of the rocket's landing location over long-range radio.
