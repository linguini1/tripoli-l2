\section{Introduction}

This document outlines the design and analysis of my Tripoli L2 certification
flight rocket. The intent of this document is to hold list all of the design
requirements, design analyses/calculations, design choices and their
justifications, design documents, bill of materials, pre-flight and post-flight
checklists, etc.

The design of this rocket is intended to be freely accessible and
well-documented such that others in the rocketry community may benefit from it.

This rocket does not intend to meet any definition of "optimality" or do
anything particularly novel; it is meant to be a low-risk rocket build that will
allow me to obtain my L2 certification and required "L2-experience" for an L3
certification as required by the new Tripoli rules. \cite[\nopp 4]{tripoli-l3}
Within that goal, I am also working within my graduate student budget, so
cost-saving measures might be made where possible. I also must acknowledge that
I am an electrical \& computer engineering student, so the design may be
disproportionately biased towards cool electronics (even where it is not cost
effective).
