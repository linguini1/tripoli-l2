# Tripoli L2 Certification Rocket

This repository contains the design files for my Tripoli L2 certification
rocket. My desire is to publicize the design files with a free-to-access intent
such that others in the rocketry hobby can benefit from them.

## Design Document

The primary design document is located in the [design-doc
directory](./design-doc). It contains the requirements, design and analysis of
the rocket along with some design files in a cohesive layout.
